            <p>Hey everyone! I'm Solas the captain/manager of the team! TEPUS started around the end of 2023 as a group of friends who loved playing Pokemon Unite. We have had a lot of success with our team and happy with each and everyone who is apart of it. I myself am the jungler playing Gardy, Leafeon, Glaceon, Mewtwo Y, and more.</p>

            <p>Hi all! I'm Jackie, and I'm the bottom-lane mage. I've been playing Unite for a couple of years and always enjoyed competitive growing up. When I first started playing, Tmacc and I would queue before we got to know the team and eventually joined in 2023. I mostly play Pikachu and Espeon but have been dabbling in other mons too!</p>

            <p>Hello, I'm the defender and the clown of the team. I only recently joined the team in 2024, and it's been a blast ever since! I mostly play Slowbro and Umbreon since they are so versatile for the team, but I love pretty much all defenders in the game. I'm hopeful we will continue to improve and learn from this amazing team!</p>
