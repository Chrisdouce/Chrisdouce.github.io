        <h2>About me:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Personal Background:</b> I originally grew up in south Florida and moved to North Carolina when I was around 10-11.</p></li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> Aside from doing some TA positions at the school, I’ve worked on a few modification for a game with friends. It’s not very popular and outclassed by other options, but personalizing something like that is very helpful for me. It’s also not paid, but gives me experience working with APIs and databases</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I’m currently a senior, planning to graduate next semester. I’ve taken all the required courses, even Computer Architecture when it was still a 3000 level class. I’m working on finishing out my concentration courses, capstone, and getting the final classes.</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I took software engineering last semester with professor Krevat and he basically went through the general gist of HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and how to tie it all together. However, while working on the final project, I realized how horrible I am at HTML and CSS + other front-end stuff so I hope to gain more experience in this class</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>ITCS-4232 - Game Design and Development Studio:</b> Capstone for my concentration, thought about the other one for software engineering and perhaps I do both.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 4236 - AI Comp Games:</b> I fined AI in games pretty interesting, always needing to find a perfect middle of good and bad + need my final concentration course.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS-3135- Web App Design and Development:</b>  Need more experience in HTML, CSS, maybe frameworks like react if we ever go there.</li>
                    <li><b>MATH 3123- Probability and Statistics II:</b>  Needed a course to fill, liked the first class, and didn’t really understand certain concepts in machine learning</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> I play a game called unite at a competitive level with a team mostly of friends. Only did one tournament which we placed 4th, but we have one coming soon!</li>
