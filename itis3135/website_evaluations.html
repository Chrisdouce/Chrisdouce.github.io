                <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva.com</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Canva is an online graphic design platform where users can make visual content. It's a versatile platform for just about any visual media like posters, logos, and presentations</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: A lot of elements stand out. Each icon has pleasing colors, the font looks nice, text is very easy to read with not to many words, and while using black on white color for text, doesn't feel offensive at all</li>
                <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: It's consistent in all the elements it displays, even in other pages. Words are wrapped and aligned the same in all places</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Very neatly spaced with not too much empty space but not filled to the brim with text or links.</li>
                <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: Everything feels very effective. Things are group where they should and make it convenient for both new and old users. Something I really like is home page shows what you can make, then you can click on what you want for a template all while not having to scroll or look for it.</li>

                <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School Â­of Art</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The Yale School of Art community wiki is a student ran site that yale student can add, remove, or edit from <em>including the design</em>. It's purposely made to be like this and there are some restrictions, but offers some funny, but horrible design choice's for a serious site like "yale.art.edu".</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: The font size, the highlight around the text, the random gradient items, black color text, all against a background repeating an image/gif makes the page unbearable to read.</li>
                <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: When switching through the main pages, there is some type of repetition in the chaos. All pages are shoved to the left and the nav for pages having some consistency</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Everything is on the left side of the screen which results in the text being wrap around every few words. It's not even spaced properly with elements feeling randomly placed around. However, the top elements are spaced nicely together</li>
                <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: Items are spaced in terrible spots. The "nav" for each page is barely okay in the left side and really tiny, when you get into "publications" or "News" it just scrolls forever, </li>
