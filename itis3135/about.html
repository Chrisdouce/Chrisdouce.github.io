        <p style="color: #70C1B3">We at Crispy Dingo CDs sell a variety of CDs from old computer games, music, podcasts, blank disk, and even ROMs! Our goal is to preserve these medias as the world moves towards streaming and downloadable content to ensure they aren't lost to time. Most products we sell can be rented and viewed as well.</p>
